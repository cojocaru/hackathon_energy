# Predictive Analysis of Energy Consumption Patterns

## Project Overview
This project is developed for a hackathon, focusing on the predictive analysis of household energy consumption. Utilizing machine learning and data analysis, our solution forecasts energy usage based on historical data, economic indicators, weather patterns, and other relevant factors. This tool aims to help households and energy providers optimize energy consumption and plan for future needs.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Preparation**: Automated scripts to collect and preprocess data from various sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the exploratory analysis of the dataset.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Implementation of machine learning models for energy consumption forecasting.
- **API for Model Serving**: Backend setup for serving the predictive model through a RESTful API.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly frontend dashboard for displaying predictions and insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Dash
- **API Development**: Flask/Django for creating RESTful APIs
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
